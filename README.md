# JavaProject_ExpenseTracker
My First Java Project - Expense Tracker is a simple Java GUI application that helps users record and manage daily expenses. It allows adding, viewing, and saving expense entries using a user-friendly interface, with all data stored in a CSV file for future reference. Built using Java Swing, it showcases basic file handling and GUI design skills.
